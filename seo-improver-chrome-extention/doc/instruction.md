# Installation Instructions for locator-integration.js

To fix the "Failed to execute 'importScripts'" error, follow these steps:

1. Copy the content from our latest file `locator-integration-with-url.js`
2. Create a new file named exactly `locator-integration.js` in your extension's root directory (where background.js is located)
3. Paste the content into this new file
4. Reload your extension in Chrome

## File Location

Make sure the file is located at:
```
[Your Extension Directory]/locator-integration.js
```

And not in a subdirectory.

## Extension Reload

After adding the file:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Find your extension
3. Click the reload icon (circular arrow)
4. Try again

## Alternative: Update manifest.json

If you prefer to keep the file in a subdirectory, you can also update your `manifest.json` to change the path of the background script:

```json
"background": {
  "service_worker": "background.js",
  "type": "module"
}
```

This makes the background script a module, which supports ES6 import syntax instead of importScripts.

Then update your background.js to use:
```javascript
import './locator-integration.js';
// or
import './path/to/locator-integration.js';
```

However, this approach requires more changes to your existing code.
